# Nenglish Stopwords for Chat Analysis 🚀🇳🇵🇬🇧

A curated list of stopwords tailored for **Nenglish** — a common blend of Nepali and English used in everyday digital communication. This list is designed to assist researchers and developers in **preprocessing informal chat data** from platforms like **WhatsApp**, **Facebook Messenger**, **Viber**, and **Telegram**.

---

## 📌 Description

In Nepal and among Nepali-speaking communities, digital conversations often contain a **mix of Nepali and English words**, also known as **Nenglish**. These conversations follow an informal structure and are filled with semantically weak words (stopwords) that add noise to natural language processing (NLP) tasks like:

- Sentiment analysis  
- Keyword extraction  
- Chat summarization  
- Intent recognition in chatbots  
- Code-mixed language modeling

This project offers a comprehensive **stopword list** combining both Nepali and English terms commonly used in informal chats. It's ideal for preprocessing **code-mixed text data** for research or production NLP applications.
